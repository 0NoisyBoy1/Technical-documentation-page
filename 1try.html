            The MV Agusta F3 675 is a revolutionary motorcycle offering extreme emotions 
            to the rider on the street and on the track. The three cylinder engine utilizes 
            a revolutionary counter-rotating crankshaft, a solution that has only been previously 
            seen on MotoGP motorcycles, together with the most compact and light weight layout ever 
            seen on a Supersport bike. These are only a few of the characteristics that make the new 
            F3 675 the most sophisticated supersport with the best handling of any sport motorcycle.
          </p>

          <p>
            The MV Agusta F3 675 engine is the most advanced and powerful middle weight engine ever produced.
            It is a ultra-compact in-line three cylinder with the perfect balance between advanced mechanical 
            engineering, extremely advanced materials and electronics technology. Thanks to the MVICS system 
            it is the first middle weight motorcycle with Full Ride By Wire engine controls including  4 pre-set 
            maps and one personally tunable map including traction control that can be selected between 8 different 
            levels.

          <p>The powerplant of the new F3, an inline 675cc three cylinder, 
             plays homage to the most victorious motorcycle brand in the word. 
             With this layout MV raced and won an unprecedented number of races 
             and world championship titles. Today the 3-cylinder engine has returned 
             in the form of a Supersport with the most advanced technical solutions and performance.</p>

          <p>This ultra-compact engine which is both incredibly short and narrow due to the unique
             layout of internal organs that only MV has been able to develop. Utilizing a 79mm bore 
             and a super-short stroke of 45,9mm the MV Agusta 3 cylinder engine is extremely over-square 
             and able to rev the highest levels ever achieved by three cylinder sports bike. Ultra-modern, 
             extremely advanced and capable of 128 cv at 14.500 rpm coupled with 71 Nm of torque at 10.600 rpm. 
             This level of performance has never been available in this category on par with the performance of
             a number of 4 cylinder engines thanks to a 15.000 rpm limit. For the first time ever, a production 
             motorcycle has utilized a counter-rotating crankshaft that contributes to the perfect dynamic balance 
             as well as increasing the lightning quick handling of the motorcycle. </p>

          <p>Ultra-compact dimensions, reduced weight and maximum performance: these are the characteristics that 
              make the engine of the new MV Agusta F3 675 the new reference in the Supersport class, an engine that 
              is destined to become the new benchmark of supersport engines. Contributing to the reduced weight and 
              compact design is the application of the “closed deck” integration of the cylinders into the crankcase 
              in a single shell mold casting along with the MVICS system and the use of titanium both for the intake 
              and exhaust valves.  </p>

            The most advanced electronic engine control system ever seen on a 
            Supersport has been designed specifically for this extraordinary new 
            three cylinder.  A system of fuel injection that is extremely sophisticated 
            using a two fuel injectors per cylinder coupled with a throttle body employing 
            50mm throttle valves, a new record for a Supersport!
          </p>

          <p>
            The F3 675 introduces for the first time the MVICS system that allows the 
            engine to unleash a record level of power and control in every situation. 
            The rider can select one of the 4 maps available, or customize an additional map 
            to obtain the power delivery desired.
          </p>

          <p>
            With the MVICS system it was possible to generate a perfect harmony between the 
            power delivery and the traction control which offers 8 levels of adjustment and 
            is accessible through the input on the left handlebar and dashboard interface.
